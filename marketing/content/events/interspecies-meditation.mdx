The Interspecies Meditation is a guided ritual designed to help people develop an affinity with non-human life forms through imaginative role-play and deep listening. It provides participants with a fun experience of possible new relations.

## What to Expect

- Draw on your own intuition to find your partner species
- A guided meditation to enter the consciousness of your chosen species
- A sharing circle where we reflect on our embodied experiences
- Thoughtful dialogue on place, ecology, and kinship across species

Whether you're an artist, activist, beach-walker, or just curious, this event offers a powerful, imaginative way to reconnect with your surroundings - and with the lives that share it.

## Practical Information

This event takes place on the beach, so please dress appropriately for the weather. Bring a blanket or towel to sit on if you prefer.

The meditation is suitable for all ages and abilities. No prior experience is necessary.

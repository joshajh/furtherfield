Experience the coast like never before in this immersive sound performance by artist collective Tidal Frequencies.

Using field recordings, live electronics, and acoustic instruments, the performers create a sonic journey through the coastal landscape - from the crash of waves on shingle to the calls of migrating birds, from the hum of container ships to the whisper of marram grass.

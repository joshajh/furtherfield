  This Coastal Town is a cultural programme bringing together artists, communities, and ideas on the Suffolk coast. We believe in the transformative power of art to reimagine our relationship with place, ecology, and each other.

  Founded by Furtherfield, the programme draws on decades of experience in participatory art and digital culture to create meaningful encounters between people and place.

  Through workshops, performances, exhibitions, and conversations, we invite you to explore new ways of seeing, being, and belonging in coastal communities.

## <a id="_fdoeviqqg6q1"></a>TCT\- What is *This Coastal Town Reimagined*?

*This Coastal Town Reimagined* works a little differently than most community visioning workshops\. It is also not a typical role\-playing game\. As an organiser, your role is to guide your group of 15\-20 people on a 3\-hour journey of imagination, conversation, and shared storytelling \- helping them explore the past, present, and \(desired\) future of their town\.

Participants will step into the shoes of children and adults with a burning passion, moving through time and collaboratively creating answers to challenges ahead, even reincarnating to be able to join in as time goes on\. There is no script for players: the story of the town emerges from their conversations, choices, and reflections\.

Your role is to hold space for ecological thinking and feeling across these generations\. Participants will imagine how communities might adapt, thrive, and care for all life along the coast\. You’ll support them\.

The game is experiential, reflective, and collaborative\. It gives participants a chance to see how small acts of solidarity ripple through decades, and to discover not just what’s possible for the town, but what’s possible for themselves as neighbours, citizens, and contributors to broader change\.

Connect across generations\. Connect with the life of the coast\. Connect global narratives with what is happening locally The workshop provides the framework \- the stories and textures are created by the participants,with your guidance helping them bring these connections to life\.

*In the off\-grid kitchen, devices are left behind as foraged flavours bring the town together…*

*Sharks stir in shadowed waters, and those who profit from extraction must now face dark depths…*

*Abandoned buildings bloom with bountiful biodiversity as young and old rewild the ruins…*

*A multi\-species cultural centre hums with life, celebrating the ways of sea and shore alike…*

These are project proposals for coastal communities created by players of *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined\.*

Since May 2024, people of all ages \- residents, workers, visitors, holidaymakers, and passionate fans of coastal settlements and marine life \- have been coming together, to share community needs and aspirations\. Through playful, creative time\-travel activities, they’ve stepped into imagined futures to explore what really matters to them\. 

From these sessions, an inspiring collection of ideas for intergenerational and multispecies solidarity is emerging, with visions of places cared for, celebrated, and thriving across culture, community, and ecology\. 

## <a id="_f1i9flb7j4yu"></a>Our Inspiration in Making this Workshop 

Welcome to *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined*\! 

With a global lack of leadership on environmental issues, many people feel that they are not ready for what the future may bring and are seeking some means to come together to face approaching uncertainties\. This three\-hour workshop has been devised to help address the gap between the global issues of our time and the things we can and would be prepared to do: to encourage people in a neighbourhood to find each other and devise ways of managing issues that stem from their varied social and ecological interests and concerns\. We share this playbook in the following pages so that any group in any small town can pick it up, make it relevant for their locality and try it out\. \(It is particularly focused on coastal regions but could be adapted for any smallish settlement\.\)

Our Inspiration in Making this Workshop  


With a global lack of leadership on environmental issues, many people feel that not enough is being done to consider the experience of the species we live amongst and on whom we depend for our lives\. These same beings are facing troubles made by human systems of governance and overconsumption\. Participants in this workshop may be actively fighting for the rights of all beings, but face exhaustion, grief or simply a desire to connect with others\. They might be involved in shaping law or policy at a global level, but feel disconnected from the places they love\. This three\-hour workshop has been devised to encourage people who already think of themselves as change\-makers with a global view to consider how their care for the life in their neighbourhoods might inform their work to manage issues of wider ecological concern\.   


At heart, *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined* is a live action role\-play exercise giving the chance for people to leap into the future of their area, speak as different generations and work successfully on issues that concern them\. By setting the action in the future, we can help participants reflect on how some of the challenges they predict can be tackled \(or, as we might put it, *were successfully tackled in the future*\) to give more inspiration for action now\. 

It has been developed to raise difficult issues supportively and in such a way that people feel stronger and more connected, rather than anxious or powerless\. It is a chance for people to find others who feel like them and who want to contribute something local to global transformation, so that no one has to act alone\. \(Importantly, this is not a piece of work defined by outsiders – only the structure is offered here; the themes emerge through groups of townsfolk global change\-makers meeting together in conversation and the key reference points are for local organisers facilitators to fill in\.\)

The workshop was created for a small UK coastal town by Ruth Catlow, director of arts organisation Furtherfield, which has been establishing itself in Felixstowe, a town of about 24,000 people, and Ann Light, an academic at the University of Sussex wanting to learn how creative participatory and immersive practices can support people in a locality to be ready for the increasingly uncertain futures ahead\.<a id="footnote-ref-0"></a>[\[1\]](#footnote-0) Initial success has led to a broader ambition: to take the best of the techniques and offer these for other contexts\. That is what we present here\.

It was devised on the understanding that people living in the same neighbourhood share some social and ecological concerns related to their environment and need something around which to gather and move from individual worry to co\-created action\. It is also designed to help people recognise how local systems are interdependent, relying on the plants, animals, and places that make up the area, just as the major global systems, such as weather, climate and geography, work together to affect what happens\. This understanding is part of supporting readiness, because changes in these relationships are part of what we are all experiencing and have to deal with\.

After an introduction to the themes \(the changing world and how it impacts locally, the key local polluters and employers, the issues that matter to the people in the room\), the workshop uses live action role\-play\. Our experience is that people are hesitant about the idea of this …but love doing it\. No one needs to be an actor; it is just a device for helping people step out of the present and play freely with ideas\. So, we tend not to emphasise this aspect before we get to the point where we ask people to create a character \(all the tools are in the following pages\)\. Instead, we refer to this as time\-travelling and using our imagination\. And we invite people to come along for the ride…

# <a id="_pmuw0zdxlj2z"></a>How to Use this Book

## <a id="_ej0v8sbfql4h"></a>We’ve provided guidelines and step\-by\-step instructions in the form of a script you can read aloud as you go\. We recommend that __two facilitators__ read through the entire script first, decide which roles to take, and make small adaptations before starting\. Seeing the bigger picture of how the exercise works will help you understand how all the pieces fit together\.

## <a id="_km8r2jonhnvs"></a>The script is designed so that, when you’re gathered with your group \- your adapted script in hand and a few resources nearby \- you can dive right in\.

If parts of the process feel a bit plain, that’s intentional\. The real energy and creativity emerge only when everyone comes together to play and begins uncovering the futures you want to create\.

## <a id="_ej0v8sbfql4h"></a>

# <a id="_qp6rz239p00r"></a>Assemble Your Team

This workshop works best when run by  a small team of people who enjoy working together and bring complementary skills and local insight\.

- __Workshop Facilitators__: We recommend two people to together adapt the script for the group and run the workshop\. A good combination is that at least one is a long\-time resident or has a deep connection to the town, and one has a broad knowledge of working with local communities\.
- __Event Support__:__ __You’ll likely need at least one additional person to support with practical hosting tasks, such as welcoming participants, managing refreshments, coordinating media releases, and helping to reorganise the room for different scenes\.
- __Documentation Team \(optional\)__: You may choose to document your event with photos and/or video\. 
- __Live Illustrator \(optional\)__: While video and photography are great for capturing actions and reflections, they often miss the richness of the imaginative worlds your participants will co\-create\. For this reason, consider inviting an illustrator to create live sketches that bring the proposals, memories, and stories to life in real time\.  If you do decide to work with an illustrator we suggest you invite them to depict the proposals shared in Scene 1, and the memories and community actions recalled in Scene 2\.

# <a id="_7cu6z3rtre7j"></a>…And Your Participants

Who do you invite to your event? Your answer to this question will vary according to the priorities of your organisation, your primary/wished\-for audiences, and the needs of your town\.

This activity works best with a diverse group of 15\-20 people\. To inspire real change in your town, aim for at least half the group to have strong local ties, and invite others, like activists, community connectors, or specialists \(e\.g\. ecologists or climate scientists\), who can help turn ideas into action and bring energy to the room\. Also consider inviting two or three thoughtful, engaged community members whom you can trust to help set the tone and support the experience \- just regular participants, not staff, but known to be good for group cohesion\.

## <a id="_lhngb5am0eda"></a>Introducing The Three Workshop Stages

The following script is designed to enable facilitators to guide participants through a structured, staged journey\. To understand more about the purpose of each scene you can refer to the list of Mechanisms on page x\. There are suggested time allocations to maintain balance, purpose and focus throughout the workshop\. We have found it useful to adhere to these\.  


__Stage 1\. Welcome, Introductions, Warm\-up Exercises \(approx 30 mins\)__

The initial welcome covers housekeeping and creates a friendly tone with some simple introductions\. Following this, the first part of the workshop situates the action in time \- somewhere between the start of industrialisation and the future this has helped to create\. Participants are asked to add events from personal, local and global history to a 200\-year timeline running back to 1875 and forward to 2075 to set the scene and start thinking about the consequences of earlier choices\.  On returning to the present, after identifying some of the issues currently concerning residents, they turn to exercises that prepare for moving forward, supporting character development and guiding players in making key decisions \- such as, choosing their age in the first scene: child, young adult, mature adult, or elder\.  


__Stage 2\. The Play \(45 mins\) __

Participants move into role and participate in 3 scenes, starting in a community space in their coastal town\. Each scene takes place in the same geographic location but approximately 5 years, 25\-30 years and 50 years into the future\. With each scene\-change our characters age a generation or reincarnate\. They must advocate for their passions and for their town in anticipation of coming change\. They look back, sharing memories and reflections of how they faced hardships together, and they gather one last time in 2075 to hear how other coastal towns have been changed by their efforts\. The 3 scenes \(plus prologue\) are as follows:__  
__

- __Prologue \- Safe Time Travel __\- We practice time travel and prepare to enter Scene 1\. \(5 minutes\)__  
__
- __Scene 1: Community Pot, 5 years in the future \- __ People gather to share their ideas for a community project that will serve all life in the town, land, sea\. \(15 minutes\)  

- __Scene 2: The Decade of Lost Summers, 2055 \- __A celebration of community resilience after 10 years of hardship\. \(20 minutes\)  

- __Scene 3: The Letter, 2075__ \- News from another coastal town\. \(5 minutes\)

__Stage 3\. De\-role and Reflection \(20 mins\)__

# <a id="_y782lhjml5bo"></a>De\-roling gives participants a chance to step out of their characters\. A short guided discussion then helps them reflect on their feelings and what they learned about their hopes for themselves, their community, and future generations in a changing town\.This is very important for participants as they hear each other make sense of what they discovered in the role\-play and also by discussing it as “themselves” they take their learning out into the world with them\. It is also an invaluable moment for the host organisation to learn what really matters to the people in the room\.   
  
This allows 10 minutes for a break and gives 5 minutes of flex in a 2 hour workshop\. For the best experience however we recommend you set aside up to 3 hours and offer refreshments so that participants have time to mingle, share their experiences, and make potentially lasting connections afterwards\.

## <a id="_mmxvkbf7o5h4"></a>Introducing The Four Workshop Stages

The following script is designed to guide participants through a structured, staged journey\. To understand more about the purpose of each scene you can refer to the list of Mechanisms on page x\. Pay close attention to the suggested time allocations to maintain balance, purpose and focus throughout the workshop\. 

__Stage 1\.__ __Welcome, Introductions, The Interspecies Meditation and Sharing Circle \(approx 45 mins\)  
__The welcome sets a friendly tone and moves into a practice to sensitise participants to the lives of other species\. Each player connects with a partner species\. This is the first step to fostering agency and solidarity across generations and species in support of readiness for coming change\.

__Stage 2\. Preparation for Play \(approx 20 mins\)__

Following this, the next part situates the action in time \- somewhere between the start of industrialisation and the future this has helped to create\. Participants are asked to add events from personal, global and partner species history to a 200\-year timeline running back to 1875 and forward to 2075 to set the scene and start thinking about the consequences of earlier choices\. On returning to the present, after identifying some of the issues currently concerning residents, they turn to exercises that prepare for moving forward, guiding players in making key decisions \- such as choosing their starting age in the first scene: child, young adult, mature adult, or elder\.  


__Stage 3\. The Play \(55 mins\) __

Participants move into role and participate in 3 scenes, starting in the first gathering of a network of cooperative coastal multispecies cultural centres \(the CCMCC\)\. The first two scenes take place in the same geographic location but approximately 5 years, 25\-30 years into the future\. The geographic location of the third scene, 50 years hence, is unspecified\. With each scene\-change our characters age a generation or reincarnate\. They must advocate for their beloved coastal / marine settlement in anticipation of coming change\. They share memories and reflections of how they faced hardships together, and they gather one last time in 2075 to give an account of how they and their partner species are impacted by changes to their habitats\. The 3 scenes \(plus prologue\) are as follows:__  
__

- __Prologue \- Safe Time Travel __\- We practice time travel and prepare to enter Scene 1\. \(5 minutes\)__  
__
- __Scene 1: Community Pot, 5 years in the future \- __ People gather to share their ideas for a community project that will improve their coastal location for all living beings\. \(15 minutes\)  

- __Scene 2: The Decade of Ailing Waters, 2055 \- __A celebration of community resilience after 10 years of hardship\. \(20 minutes\)  

- __Scene 3: The Letters of Account, 2075__ \-  offer an overview of the state of our coastal planet, in the year of 2075\. \(15 minutes\)

__Stage 3\. De\-role and Reflection \(20 mins\)__

# <a id="_r6ucdqqjbwl5"></a>De\-roling gives participants a chance to step out of their characters\. A short guided discussion then helps them reflect on their feelings and what they learned about their hopes for themselves, their community, and future generations\.This is important for participants as they hear each other make sense of what they have discovered in the role\-play\. By discussing it out of role, it consolidates the learning and they take their insights out into the world with them\. It is also an invaluable moment for the host organisation to learn what really matters to the people in the room\.   
  
We suggest you leave a 10 minute break after the Interspecies Meditation\. For the best experience however we recommend you set aside 3 hours so that participants have time to mingle, share their experiences, and make potentially lasting connections afterwards\.

# <a id="_s4hs67u1f92v"></a>Checklist \- What You Need to Run the Workshop

### <a id="_3b2fkjp8sf73"></a>The Script

Before hosting this event, you'll need to lightly add detail to the script to reflect the realities of your coastal town\. The more recognisable you make your town to your participants, with relevant context about places, people, the lives of other beings, the more immersive it will feel\. By doing this, you help your participants bring their own experiences, passions, and challenges \- fostering relationships within the group that inspire and enable community action\.

The Script

Before hosting this event, you'll need to lightly add detail to the script to help your participants’ connect their priorities to their experience of coastal regions that they know\. Adapting the script with context about global polluters, wildlife and existing campaigns for positive eco\-social outcomes will make this feel more relevant for participants and help them immerse themselves in the drama\.

Adding notes of events to timeline \(including some seeded eco\-social notes by facilitators as examples\)

Introducing eco\-social and industrialisation themes obliquely, giving a hint of the connectedness of the eco\-social, revealing the complexity of systems

Issue circle – going round each person once in sequence

Gathering insight into the town and people’s feelings about the town, without opportunity for wallowing or airing grievances

No repetition of themes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            in circle 

Adding speed while removing chance to disappear down frustration rabbit holes

Circling back to any missed voices, without demanding contribution

Showing that everyone counts, showing that there is no pressure to perform

*Development of story*

Character for role\-play as ‘alter ego’ for action

Inviting people to step out of everyday concerns and giving them ‘alibi’ to be passionate or concerned and vocal, distancing themselves from their normal voices

You are a person who cares: your character will make the changes you want to see to support life

Interpellating people into their most active/activist and committed ‘alter ego’ selves

Character sheet with set choices

Setting up this distancing device with easy options for the shy or uninspired

Sections for free\-form entry on passions and proposals for change

Encouraging participants to think of things they want to advocate for, accentuating the positive and active

Choice of starting age group

Adding emphasis to future orientation and importance of multiplicity of voices

Sitting at tables relating to chosen age group

Building intergenerational awareness and developing ideas in cohort\-specific fashion

Limiting number of places at each ‘age’ table to force a spread of ages

Hearing from multiple orientations \(and ensuring that subsequent sections can work with sufficient variety of age groups for story\)

Silent spectrum of ages exercise

Giving information to everyone, getting people moving, having simple fun

Moving as character, pinpointing different energy

Practicing and developing role, finding a different age in their body to present with, supporting intergenerational understanding

Interacting with others and sharing proposals

Preparing for selecting proposals, while reinforcing play relations in group

Pebble to choose from pile on table

Choosing gives a small measure of control to the participants; holding a pebble gives body to the alter ego with an enduring physical object that grounds the magic

Reincarnation structure \(elders return as kids at a scene change\)

Experiencing different life stages; reinforcing a sense of moving through time; allowing for multiple age groups, gaining/recalling insight into different generations

Seats in a circle

Flattening agency, allowing everyone to see each other, sharing the load 

*Scene 1:*

Using the future

Making space for something new to be born; engaging with anticipated challenges of development and climate

Interplay of 2 facilitators

Using play\-off between them to establish the scene lightly, while offering extra scene\-setting facilitation for people not used to roleplay\.

Illustrator \(if used\)

Producing images that can be referred to \(and waved\) in the next scene, capturing ideas

A community pot of money

Inviting people to consider priorities with a kind of notional participatory budgeting

Biscuits

Relieving tension at the start of the role playing and modelling care, puncturing pomposity of scene to show dynamics between facilitators and make play interesting, not just instrumental

Facilitator *in role* humour 

Reducing the seriousness of the roleplaying for everyone, demonstrating the enduring issue of group dynamics, having fun

The two proposals \(or more\)

Getting the chosen pair to share their ideas to start others thinking about the changes possible in the future

Invitations to talk

Soliciting personal and group perspectives on the issues facing the town; exploring the practicalities of and developing proposals, adding aspects of other proposals to those presented and synthesising 

Facilitator prompts to join

Fishing for other voices, looking at inclusion

Moment of reflection

Fixing the ideas and making them memorable both for the next scene and possible take\-up 

*Scene 2*

Suggestion that Scene 1 ideas now support the town 

Giving the group material to use, reinforcing the agency of the group at problem\-mitigating and creating alternative futures, endorsing the community’s solutions

Decade of Lost Summers

Offering a projection for amorphous fears/sense of loss from group, acting as a compelling but empty signifier

Action starts after the decade when the immediate danger has passed

Allowing people to project horror retrospectively rather than live it, protecting group from debilitating emotions

Children and young people lead action

Dividing the labour of invention between two groups – those formulating deliberately naïve questions and those finding answers and thereby world\-building

Prompts that invite world\-building

Giving extra kicking\-off points for invention, lessening the creative load and inviting quieter members into discussion, amplifying what the years entailed

Frame of ‘how we got through it’

Playing on positives and strengths, so every challenge is already historic, revealing resilience in the process of working out answers

*Ending*

The Letter

Giving an upbeat closure to a short overall session where we have responsibility for wellbeing, pulling in ideas from earlier parts as reinforcement and a sense of achievement, wrapping up

De\-role

Digesting experience and returning to self 

Moment of reflection

Shifting back to person with views on what the experience means and summoning these for sharing

Future timeline additions – things worth remembering from the exercise

Capturing stories and ideas from the session, fixing the thinking and the group’s priorities in writing to support commitment, preparing for the extended reflection next

Extended debrief

Ensuring that return to ordinary life takes learning with it: stating realigned priorities, hearing others’ views, making observations, sharing feedback, making pledges and being together in a new relation to each other, thinking about ‘what next?

Final words of challenge and thanks

Reminding of the challenging contexts to come, but also taking life forward constructively, building the possibility of local networks

Gathering insight on feelings about both common and distinct coastal/marine conditions\.

No repetition of themes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            in circle 

Adding speed while removing chance to disappear down frustration rabbit holes

Circling back to any missed voices, without demanding contribution

Showing that everyone counts, showing that there is no pressure to perform

*Development of story*

Running a Live Action Roleplay

Transporting people into imaginary contexts to discuss real issues without miring them in overly practical concerns

Character for role\-play as ‘alter ego’ for action

Inviting people to step out of everyday concerns and giving them ‘alibi’ to be passionate or concerned and vocal, distancing themselves from their normal voices

You are a person who cares: your character will make the changes you want to see to support life\. You are a person with a responsibility to represent and agency to act in a CCMCC

Interpellating people into their most active/activist and committed ‘alter ego’ selves

Character sheet with set choices

Setting up this distancing device with easy options for the shy or uninspired

Sections for free\-form entry on passions and proposals for change

Encouraging participants to think of things they want to advocate for, accentuating the positive and active

Choice of starting age group

Adding emphasis to future orientation and importance of multiplicity of voices

Sitting at tables relating to chosen age group

Building intergenerational awareness and developing ideas in cohort\-specific fashion

Limiting number of places at each ‘age’ table to force a spread of ages

Hearing from multiple orientations \(and ensuring that subsequent sections can work with sufficient variety of age groups for story\)

Silent spectrum of human ages exercise

Giving information to everyone, getting people moving, having simple fun\. 

Spectrum of species lifetimes 

To keep the partner species in mind

Interacting with others and sharing proposals

Preparing for selecting proposals, while reinforcing play relations in group

Pebble to choose from pile on table

Choosing gives a small measure of control to the participants; holding a pebble gives body to the alter ego with an enduring physical object that grounds the magic

Reincarnation structure \(elders return as kids at a scene change\)

Experiencing different life stages; reinforcing a sense of moving through time; allowing for multiple age groups, gaining/recalling insight into different generations

Seats in a circle

Flattening agency, allowing everyone to see each other, sharing the load 

*Scene 1:*

Using the future

Making space for something new to be born; engaging with anticipated challenges of development and climate

Interplay of 2 facilitators – archetypes of an overbearing controller and a timid resource\-r

Using play\-off between them to establish the scene lightly, while offering extra scene\-setting facilitation for people not used to roleplay\.

Illustrator \(if used\)

Producing images that can be referred to \(and waved\) in the next scene, capturing ideas

An invitation from UNESCO to create a network of cooperative coastal multi\-species cultural centres

Inviting people to consider shared and diverging priorities 

Funded by a plausible polluter even if funding is fictitious

Gives relevance and tinges the group’s work with context, perhaps a sense of defiance \(also facilitator B could work for this outfit/has approached them\) \- looking for something that works to link people anywhere in world

Sea\-related snack \(e\.g\. seaweed popcorn\) and reading the ingredients out as part of a humorous disruption\. 

Relieving tension at the start of the role playing and modelling care, showing dynamics between facilitators and make play interesting, not just instrumental\.

Facilitators use familiar archetypes of  campaign leader and resourcer\.

Making the leadership of the roleplay familiar to participants so that they can align, reducing any intimidation of the figures

Facilitator *in role* humour 

Reducing the seriousness of the roleplaying for everyone, demonstrating the enduring issue of group dynamics, having fun

The two proposals \(or more\)

Getting the chosen pair to share their ideas to start others thinking about the changes possible in the future

Invitations to talk

Soliciting personal and group perspectives on the issues facing the town; exploring the practicalities of and developing proposals, adding aspects of other proposals to those presented and synthesising 

Facilitator prompts to join

Fishing for other voices, looking at inclusion

Moment of reflection

Fixing the ideas and making them memorable both for the next scene and possible take\-up 

*Scene 2*

Suggestion that Scene 1 ideas now support the town 

Giving the group material to use, reinforcing the agency of the group at problem\-mitigating and creating alternative futures, endorsing the community’s solutions

Decade of Ailing Waters

Offering a projection for amorphous fears/sense of loss from group, acting as a compelling but empty signifier

Action starts after the decade when the immediate danger has passed

Allowing people to project horror retrospectively rather than live it, protecting group from debilitating emotions

Children and young people lead action

Dividing the labour of invention between two groups – those formulating deliberately naïve questions and those finding answers and thereby world\-building

Prompts that invite world\-building

Giving extra kicking\-off points for invention, lessening the creative load and inviting quieter members into discussion, amplifying what the years entailed

Frame of ‘how we got through it’

Playing on positives and strengths, so every challenge is already historic, revealing resilience in the process of working out answers

*Ending*

Moment of reflection on 20 more years’ impact on partner species

moving 20 years forward quickly, focusing on environmental change, without need for sociopolitical  
Preparation for an ending “staying with the trouble” with melancholy note

Writing the letter of account as eulogy or celebration

Recognising the likely emotional engagement and agency of participants, this section allows participants to negotiate with their own sense of integrity and truth as they write the future\.

Reading letters aloud in the group

Doing reflective work in role in group round the circle

De\-role

Digesting experience and returning to self 

Moment of reflection

Shifting back to person with views on what the experience means and summoning these for sharing

Extended debrief

Ensuring that return to ordinary life takes learning with it: stating realigned priorities, hearing others’ views, making observations, sharing feedback, making pledges and being together in a new relation to each other, thinking about ‘what next?

Final words of thanks and promise to share letters and connect people through that

Reminding of the challenging contexts to come, but also taking life forward constructively, building the possibility of networks

# How to Use this Book

We've provided guidelines and step-by-step instructions in the form of a script you can read aloud as you go. We recommend that **two facilitators** read through the entire script first, decide which roles to take, and make small adaptations before starting. Seeing the bigger picture of how the exercise works will help you understand how all the pieces fit together.

The script is designed so that, when you're gathered with your group - your adapted script in hand and a few resources nearby - you can dive right in.

> If parts of the process feel a bit plain, that's intentional. The real energy and creativity emerge only when everyone comes together to play and begins uncovering the futures you want to create.

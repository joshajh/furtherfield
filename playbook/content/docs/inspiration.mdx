# Our Inspiration in Making this Workshop

Welcome to *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined*!

With a global lack of leadership on environmental issues, many people feel that they are not ready for what the future may bring and are seeking some means to come together to face approaching uncertainties. This three-hour workshop has been devised to help address the gap between the global issues of our time and the things we can and would be prepared to do: to encourage people in a neighbourhood to find each other and devise ways of managing issues that stem from their varied social and ecological interests and concerns.

We share this playbook in the following pages so that any group in any small town can pick it up, make it relevant for their locality and try it out. (It is particularly focused on coastal regions but could be adapted for any smallish settlement.)

With a global lack of leadership on environmental issues, many people feel that not enough is being done to consider the experience of the species we live amongst and on whom we depend for our lives. These same beings are facing troubles made by human systems of governance and overconsumption. Participants in this workshop may be actively fighting for the rights of all beings, but face exhaustion, grief or simply a desire to connect with others. They might be involved in shaping law or policy at a global level, but feel disconnected from the places they love.

This three-hour workshop has been devised to encourage people who already think of themselves as change-makers with a global view to consider how their care for the life in their neighbourhoods might inform their work to manage issues of wider ecological concern.

At heart, *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined* is a live action role-play exercise giving the chance for people to leap into the future of their area, speak as different generations and work successfully on issues that concern them. By setting the action in the future, we can help participants reflect on how some of the challenges they predict can be tackled (or, as we might put it, *were successfully tackled in the future*) to give more inspiration for action now.

It has been developed to raise difficult issues supportively and in such a way that people feel stronger and more connected, rather than anxious or powerless. It is a chance for people to find others who feel like them and who want to contribute something local to global transformation, so that no one has to act alone.

> Importantly, this is not a piece of work defined by outsiders – only the structure is offered here; the themes emerge through groups of townsfolk global change-makers meeting together in conversation and the key reference points are for local organisers facilitators to fill in.

The workshop was created for a small UK coastal town by Ruth Catlow, director of arts organisation Furtherfield, which has been establishing itself in Felixstowe, a town of about 24,000 people, and Ann Light, an academic at the University of Sussex wanting to learn how creative participatory and immersive practices can support people in a locality to be ready for the increasingly uncertain futures ahead. Initial success has led to a broader ambition: to take the best of the techniques and offer these for other contexts. That is what we present here.

It was devised on the understanding that people living in the same neighbourhood share some social and ecological concerns related to their environment and need something around which to gather and move from individual worry to co-created action. It is also designed to help people recognise how local systems are interdependent, relying on the plants, animals, and places that make up the area, just as the major global systems, such as weather, climate and geography, work together to affect what happens. This understanding is part of supporting readiness, because changes in these relationships are part of what we are all experiencing and have to deal with.

## The Role-Play Approach

After an introduction to the themes (the changing world and how it impacts locally, the key local polluters and employers, the issues that matter to the people in the room), the workshop uses live action role-play. Our experience is that people are hesitant about the idea of this... but love doing it.

No one needs to be an actor; it is just a device for helping people step out of the present and play freely with ideas. So, we tend not to emphasise this aspect before we get to the point where we ask people to create a character (all the tools are in the following pages). Instead, we refer to this as time-travelling and using our imagination.

> And we invite people to come along for the ride...

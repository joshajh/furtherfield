# Checklist - What You Need to Run the Workshop

## The Script

Before hosting this event, you'll need to lightly add detail to the script to reflect the realities of your coastal town. The more recognisable you make your town to your participants, with relevant context about places, people, the lives of other beings, the more immersive it will feel.

By doing this, you help your participants bring their own experiences, passions, and challenges - fostering relationships within the group that inspire and enable community action.

### TCP Version
Before hosting this event, you'll need to lightly add detail to the script to help your participants' connect their priorities to their experience of coastal regions that they know. Adapting the script with context about global polluters, wildlife and existing campaigns for positive eco-social outcomes will make this feel more relevant for participants and help them immerse themselves in the drama.

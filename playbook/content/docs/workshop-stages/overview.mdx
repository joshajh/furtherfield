# Introducing The Workshop Stages

The following script is designed to enable facilitators to guide participants through a structured, staged journey. To understand more about the purpose of each scene you can refer to the [Mechanisms](/docs/mechanisms) section. There are suggested time allocations to maintain balance, purpose and focus throughout the workshop. We have found it useful to adhere to these.

## TCT Version (This Coastal Town)

### Stage 1: Welcome, Introductions, Warm-up Exercises
**Approx 30 mins**

The initial welcome covers housekeeping and creates a friendly tone with some simple introductions. Following this, the first part of the workshop situates the action in time - somewhere between the start of industrialisation and the future this has helped to create.

Participants are asked to add events from personal, local and global history to a 200-year timeline running back to 1875 and forward to 2075 to set the scene and start thinking about the consequences of earlier choices.

On returning to the present, after identifying some of the issues currently concerning residents, they turn to exercises that prepare for moving forward, supporting character development and guiding players in making key decisions - such as, choosing their age in the first scene: child, young adult, mature adult, or elder.

### Stage 2: The Play
**45 mins**

Participants move into role and participate in 3 scenes, starting in a community space in their coastal town. Each scene takes place in the same geographic location but approximately 5 years, 25-30 years and 50 years into the future.

With each scene-change our characters age a generation or reincarnate. They must advocate for their passions and for their town in anticipation of coming change. They look back, sharing memories and reflections of how they faced hardships together, and they gather one last time in 2075 to hear how other coastal towns have been changed by their efforts.

The 3 scenes (plus prologue) are as follows:

- **Prologue - Safe Time Travel** - We practice time travel and prepare to enter Scene 1. (5 minutes)
- **Scene 1: Community Pot, 5 years in the future** - People gather to share their ideas for a community project that will serve all life in the town, land, sea. (15 minutes)
- **Scene 2: The Decade of Lost Summers, 2055** - A celebration of community resilience after 10 years of hardship. (20 minutes)
- **Scene 3: The Letter, 2075** - News from another coastal town. (5 minutes)

### Stage 3: De-role and Reflection
**20 mins**

De-roling gives participants a chance to step out of their characters. A short guided discussion then helps them reflect on their feelings and what they learned about their hopes for themselves, their community, and future generations in a changing town.

This is very important for participants as they hear each other make sense of what they discovered in the role-play and also by discussing it as "themselves" they take their learning out into the world with them. It is also an invaluable moment for the host organisation to learn what really matters to the people in the room.

This allows 10 minutes for a break and gives 5 minutes of flex in a 2 hour workshop. For the best experience however we recommend you set aside up to 3 hours and offer refreshments so that participants have time to mingle, share their experiences, and make potentially lasting connections afterwards.

## TCP Version (This Coastal Planet)

### Stage 1: Welcome, Introductions, The Interspecies Meditation and Sharing Circle
**Approx 45 mins**

The welcome sets a friendly tone and moves into a practice to sensitise participants to the lives of other species. Each player connects with a partner species. This is the first step to fostering agency and solidarity across generations and species in support of readiness for coming change.

### Stage 2: Preparation for Play
**Approx 20 mins**

Following this, the next part situates the action in time - somewhere between the start of industrialisation and the future this has helped to create.

Participants are asked to add events from personal, global and partner species history to a 200-year timeline running back to 1875 and forward to 2075 to set the scene and start thinking about the consequences of earlier choices.

On returning to the present, after identifying some of the issues currently concerning residents, they turn to exercises that prepare for moving forward, guiding players in making key decisions - such as choosing their starting age in the first scene: child, young adult, mature adult, or elder.

### Stage 3: The Play
**55 mins**

Participants move into role and participate in 3 scenes, starting in the first gathering of a network of cooperative coastal multispecies cultural centres (the CCMCC). The first two scenes take place in the same geographic location but approximately 5 years, 25-30 years into the future. The geographic location of the third scene, 50 years hence, is unspecified.

With each scene-change our characters age a generation or reincarnate. They must advocate for their beloved coastal / marine settlement in anticipation of coming change. They share memories and reflections of how they faced hardships together, and they gather one last time in 2075 to give an account of how they and their partner species are impacted by changes to their habitats.

The 3 scenes (plus prologue) are as follows:

- **Prologue - Safe Time Travel** - We practice time travel and prepare to enter Scene 1. (5 minutes)
- **Scene 1: Community Pot, 5 years in the future** - People gather to share their ideas for a community project that will improve their coastal location for all living beings. (15 minutes)
- **Scene 2: The Decade of Ailing Waters, 2055** - A celebration of community resilience after 10 years of hardship. (20 minutes)
- **Scene 3: The Letters of Account, 2075** - Offer an overview of the state of our coastal planet, in the year of 2075. (15 minutes)

### Stage 4: De-role and Reflection
**20 mins**

De-roling gives participants a chance to step out of their characters. A short guided discussion then helps them reflect on their feelings and what they learned about their hopes for themselves, their community, and future generations.

This is important for participants as they hear each other make sense of what they have discovered in the role-play. By discussing it out of role, it consolidates the learning and they take their insights out into the world with them. It is also an invaluable moment for the host organisation to learn what really matters to the people in the room.

We suggest you leave a 10 minute break after the Interspecies Meditation. For the best experience however we recommend you set aside 3 hours so that participants have time to mingle, share their experiences, and make potentially lasting connections afterwards.

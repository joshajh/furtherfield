# Mechanisms

This section explains the purpose and design rationale behind each element of the workshop.

---

## Introductory Section

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Meet one other person to find a connection | Introducing the solidarity theme by enactment |
| Timeline stretching 150 years back and 50 years on | Linking past to present to future and setting the temporal theme, giving first encounter with the idea of systems and impacts, introducing the idea of interconnectedness of events |
| Timeline divided in layers – global, town, personal | Linking the *here and now* with wider challenges (the *then and there*, i.e. situating ourselves in time and place at different scales) |
| Adding notes of events to timeline (including some seeded eco-social notes by facilitators as examples) | Introducing eco-social and industrialisation themes obliquely, giving a hint of the connectedness of the eco-social, revealing the complexity of systems |
| Issue circle – going round each person once in sequence | Gathering insight into the town and people's feelings about the town, without opportunity for wallowing or airing grievances |
| No repetition of themes in circle | Adding speed while removing chance to disappear down frustration rabbit holes |
| Circling back to any missed voices, without demanding contribution | Showing that everyone counts, showing that there is no pressure to perform |

## Development of Story

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Character for role-play as 'alter ego' for action | Inviting people to step out of everyday concerns and giving them 'alibi' to be passionate or concerned and vocal, distancing themselves from their normal voices |
| You are a person who cares: your character will make the changes you want to see to support life | Interpellating people into their most active/activist and committed 'alter ego' selves |
| Character sheet with set choices | Setting up this distancing device with easy options for the shy or uninspired |
| Sections for free-form entry on passions and proposals for change | Encouraging participants to think of things they want to advocate for, accentuating the positive and active |
| Choice of starting age group | Adding emphasis to future orientation and importance of multiplicity of voices |
| Sitting at tables relating to chosen age group | Building intergenerational awareness and developing ideas in cohort-specific fashion |
| Limiting number of places at each 'age' table to force a spread of ages | Hearing from multiple orientations (and ensuring that subsequent sections can work with sufficient variety of age groups for story) |
| Silent spectrum of ages exercise | Giving information to everyone, getting people moving, having simple fun |
| Moving as character, pinpointing different energy | Practicing and developing role, finding a different age in their body to present with, supporting intergenerational understanding |
| Interacting with others and sharing proposals | Preparing for selecting proposals, while reinforcing play relations in group |
| Pebble to choose from pile on table | Choosing gives a small measure of control to the participants; holding a pebble gives body to the alter ego with an enduring physical object that grounds the magic |
| Reincarnation structure (elders return as kids at a scene change) | Experiencing different life stages; reinforcing a sense of moving through time; allowing for multiple age groups, gaining/recalling insight into different generations |
| Seats in a circle | Flattening agency, allowing everyone to see each other, sharing the load |

## Scene 1

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Using the future | Making space for something new to be born; engaging with anticipated challenges of development and climate |
| Interplay of 2 facilitators | Using play-off between them to establish the scene lightly, while offering extra scene-setting facilitation for people not used to roleplay |
| Illustrator (if used) | Producing images that can be referred to (and waved) in the next scene, capturing ideas |
| A community pot of money | Inviting people to consider priorities with a kind of notional participatory budgeting |
| Biscuits | Relieving tension at the start of the role playing and modelling care, puncturing pomposity of scene to show dynamics between facilitators and make play interesting, not just instrumental |
| Facilitator *in role* humour | Reducing the seriousness of the roleplaying for everyone, demonstrating the enduring issue of group dynamics, having fun |
| The two proposals (or more) | Getting the chosen pair to share their ideas to start others thinking about the changes possible in the future |
| Invitations to talk | Soliciting personal and group perspectives on the issues facing the town; exploring the practicalities of and developing proposals, adding aspects of other proposals to those presented and synthesising |
| Facilitator prompts to join | Fishing for other voices, looking at inclusion |
| Moment of reflection | Fixing the ideas and making them memorable both for the next scene and possible take-up |

---

## Scene 2

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Suggestion that Scene 1 ideas now support the town | Giving the group material to use, reinforcing the agency of the group at problem-mitigating and creating alternative futures, endorsing the community's solutions |
| Decade of Lost Summers (TCT) / Decade of Ailing Waters (TCP) | Offering a projection for amorphous fears/sense of loss from group, acting as a compelling but empty signifier |
| Action starts after the decade when the immediate danger has passed | Allowing people to project horror retrospectively rather than live it, protecting group from debilitating emotions |
| Children and young people lead action | Dividing the labour of invention between two groups – those formulating deliberately naïve questions and those finding answers and thereby world-building |
| Prompts that invite world-building | Giving extra kicking-off points for invention, lessening the creative load and inviting quieter members into discussion, amplifying what the years entailed |
| Frame of 'how we got through it' | Playing on positives and strengths, so every challenge is already historic, revealing resilience in the process of working out answers |

## Ending

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| The Letter (TCT) / The Letters of Account (TCP) | Giving an upbeat closure to a short overall session where we have responsibility for wellbeing, pulling in ideas from earlier parts as reinforcement and a sense of achievement, wrapping up |
| De-role | Digesting experience and returning to self |
| Moment of reflection | Shifting back to person with views on what the experience means and summoning these for sharing |
| Future timeline additions – things worth remembering from the exercise | Capturing stories and ideas from the session, fixing the thinking and the group's priorities in writing to support commitment, preparing for the extended reflection next |
| Extended debrief | Ensuring that return to ordinary life takes learning with it: stating realigned priorities, hearing others' views, making observations, sharing feedback, making pledges and being together in a new relation to each other, thinking about 'what next?' |
| Final words of challenge and thanks | Reminding of the challenging contexts to come, but also taking life forward constructively, building the possibility of local networks |

## TCP-Specific Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Purpose for participants |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Interspecies Meditation with coastal/marine species and short sharing circle in role | Anchors participants in a relationship that is linked to places, but different places, offering precise and personal, sensitisation and wellbeing reference point, without community of place |
| Timeline divided in layers – global eco-social, coastal, partner species events | Allowing personal connections to the *here and now* with wider challenges (the *then and there*, i.e. situating ourselves in time and place at different scales) facilitating engagement with general coastal theme, but with meaningful global anchors |
| Issue circle – going round each person once in sequence (excited/worried) | Gathering insight on feelings about both common and distinct coastal/marine conditions |
| Running a Live Action Roleplay | Transporting people into imaginary contexts to discuss real issues without miring them in overly practical concerns |
| You are a person with a responsibility to represent and agency to act in a CCMCC | Interpellating people into their most active/activist and committed 'alter ego' selves |
| Spectrum of species lifetimes | To keep the partner species in mind |
| An invitation from UNESCO to create a network of cooperative coastal multi-species cultural centres | Inviting people to consider shared and diverging priorities |
| Funded by a plausible polluter even if funding is fictitious | Gives relevance and tinges the group's work with context, perhaps a sense of defiance (also facilitator B could work for this outfit/has approached them) - looking for something that works to link people anywhere in world |
| Sea-related snack (e.g. seaweed popcorn) and reading the ingredients out as part of a humorous disruption | Relieving tension at the start of the role playing and modelling care, showing dynamics between facilitators and make play interesting, not just instrumental |
| Facilitators use familiar archetypes of campaign leader and resourcer | Making the leadership of the roleplay familiar to participants so that they can align, reducing any intimidation of the figures |
| Moment of reflection on 20 more years' impact on partner species | Moving 20 years forward quickly, focusing on environmental change, without need for sociopolitical. Preparation for an ending "staying with the trouble" with melancholy note |
| Writing the letter of account as eulogy or celebration | Recognising the likely emotional engagement and agency of participants, this section allows participants to negotiate with their own sense of integrity and truth as they write the future |
| Reading letters aloud in the group | Doing reflective work in role in group round the circle |
| Final words of thanks and promise to share letters and connect people through that | Reminding of the challenging contexts to come, but also taking life forward constructively, building the possibility of networks |

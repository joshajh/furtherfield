# This Coastal Town / Planet Reimagined

A time-travel playbook for inspiring coastal communities, by Ruth Catlow and Ann Light.

---

**Note:** This playbook comes in two versions:
- **TCT (This Coastal Town)** - For local community workshops
- **TCP (This Coastal Planet)** - For globally-focused sessions

## What is This Coastal Town Reimagined?

*This Coastal Town Reimagined* works a little differently than most community visioning workshops. It is also not a typical role-playing game. As an organiser, your role is to guide your group of 15-20 people on a 3-hour journey of imagination, conversation, and shared storytelling - helping them explore the past, present, and (desired) future of their town.

Participants will step into the shoes of children and adults with a burning passion, moving through time and collaboratively creating answers to challenges ahead, even reincarnating to be able to join in as time goes on. There is no script for players: the story of the town emerges from their conversations, choices, and reflections.

Your role is to hold space for ecological thinking and feeling across these generations. Participants will imagine how communities might adapt, thrive, and care for all life along the coast. You'll support them.

The game is experiential, reflective, and collaborative. It gives participants a chance to see how small acts of solidarity ripple through decades, and to discover not just what's possible for the town, but what's possible for themselves as neighbours, citizens, and contributors to broader change.

> Connect across generations. Connect with the life of the coast. Connect global narratives with what is happening locally.

The workshop provides the framework - the stories and textures are created by the participants, with your guidance helping them bring these connections to life.

## What is This Coastal Planet Reimagined?

*This Coastal Planet Reimagined* works a little differently than most community visioning workshops. It is also not a typical role-playing game. As a facilitator, your role is to guide your group of 15-20 people on a 3-hour journey of imagination, conversation, and shared storytelling - helping them explore the past, present, and future of coastal/marine settlements they care about.

Participants will step into the shoes of children and adults with a burning passion, moving through time and collaboratively creating answers to challenges ahead, even reincarnating to be able to join in as time goes on.

Your role is to hold space for generational and ecological thinking and feeling across these generations. Participants will imagine how connected human communities might adapt, thrive, and care for all coastal and marine life. You'll support them.

The game is experiential, reflective, and collaborative. It gives participants a chance to see how small acts of solidarity ripple through decades and across the globe - considering how to operate as active agents of broader change.

> Connect across generations. Connect across distance. Connect with coastal and marine life.

The game provides the framework - the stories and textures are created by the participants - with your guidance.

*In the off-grid kitchen, devices are left behind as foraged flavours bring the town together...*

*Sharks stir in shadowed waters, and those who profit from extraction must now face dark depths...*

*Abandoned buildings bloom with bountiful biodiversity as young and old rewild the ruins...*

*A multi-species cultural centre hums with life, celebrating the ways of sea and shore alike...*

These are project proposals for coastal communities created by players of *This Coastal Town Planet Reimagined.*

Since May 2024, people of all ages - residents, workers, visitors, holidaymakers, and passionate fans of coastal settlements and marine life - have been coming together, to share community needs and aspirations. Through playful, creative time-travel activities, they've stepped into imagined futures to explore what really matters to them.

From these sessions, an inspiring collection of ideas for intergenerational and multispecies solidarity is emerging, with visions of places cared for, celebrated, and thriving across culture, community, and ecology.

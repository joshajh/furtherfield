## About the Interspecies Meditation

*The Interspecies Meditation and Sharing Circle* was developed by Ruth Catlow and Sarah Friend at the Glitch Community Residency at Château du Feÿ, in France, October 2021.

It has since been reused and adapted by Furtherfield and Max Dovey to support immersion and participation in the Multispecies Assemblies and Interspecies Festival as part of *The Treaty of Finsbury Park* 2022-25.

It has been further adapted with Ann Light for *This Coastal Planet Reimagined.*

The bonding ritual was originally created for a multispecies food justice LARP called *Now London is a City Farm...* created by Ruth with Sara Heitlinger, Lara Houston and Alex Taylor as part of the Algorithmic Food Justice research project.

It is licensed under a **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 Licence**, which means that it can be freely distributed and played with credit to the creators.

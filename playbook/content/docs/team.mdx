# Assemble Your Team

This workshop works best when run by a small team of people who enjoy working together and bring complementary skills and local insight.

## Required Roles

### Workshop Facilitators

We recommend two people to together adapt the script for the group and run the workshop. A good combination is that at least one is a long-time resident or has a deep connection to the town, and one has a broad knowledge of working with local communities.

### Event Support

You'll likely need at least one additional person to support with practical hosting tasks, such as:

- Welcoming participants
- Managing refreshments
- Coordinating media releases
- Helping to reorganise the room for different scenes

## Optional Roles

### Documentation Team

You may choose to document your event with photos and/or video.

### Live Illustrator

While video and photography are great for capturing actions and reflections, they often miss the richness of the imaginative worlds your participants will co-create. For this reason, consider inviting an illustrator to create live sketches that bring the proposals, memories, and stories to life in real time.

If you do decide to work with an illustrator we suggest you invite them to depict:

- The proposals shared in Scene 1
- The memories and community actions recalled in Scene 2

# ...And Your Participants

Who do you invite to your event? Your answer to this question will vary according to the priorities of your organisation, your primary/wished-for audiences, and the needs of your town.

This activity works best with a diverse group of **15-20 people**. To inspire real change in your town, aim for at least half the group to have strong local ties, and invite others, like activists, community connectors, or specialists (e.g. ecologists or climate scientists), who can help turn ideas into action and bring energy to the room.

Also consider inviting two or three thoughtful, engaged community members whom you can trust to help set the tone and support the experience - just regular participants, not staff, but known to be good for group cohesion.
